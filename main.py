#We are predicting what will happen in the code. 

#Predict and Run Example 1
 # The code will print what is in the variabel firstName which is Andy. 

firstName = "Andy"

print(firstName)

#Predict and Run Example 2
 # The code will print what is in the variable fullName. Within full name, there is the 
#concatenation of the two variables firstName, lastName and a space. Therefore the code 
# will print Andy Colley

lastName = "Colley"

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

print(fullName)

#Predict and Run Example 3
 # The code will print "Hello Andy. Your full name is Andy Colley."

print("Hello " + firstName + ". Your full name is " + fullName + ".")
